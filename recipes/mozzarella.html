        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This dish is perfection, and is best made at the peak of summer when you can get tomatoes directly from the farm. 
            There's really nothing more to say.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>Grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>15 basil leaves, shredded</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons oregano, chopped</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons best quality extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to finish</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons grapeseed oil</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Maldon sea salt</li>
            <li>8 to 9 ounces buffalo mozzarella</li>
            <li>2 medium ripe tomatoes (red, yellow or mixed)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Scatter the fennel seeds in a small frying pan over medium heat and dry-roast until they 
                begin to pop. Transfer to a mortar and pestle and crush roughly. Place the crushed seeds 
                in a small bowl and add the remaining marinade ingredients.</li>
            <li>Break the mozzarella roughly with your hands. Smear it with the marinade and set aside 
                for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>To serve, cut the tomatoes into wedges and plate along with the marinated mozzarella. Drizzle 
                with extra olive oil and serve.</li>
        </ol>
