        <h3 class="header">Description</h3>
        <p>Marcella Hazan brings us this incredible dish in her classic cookbook 'Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking'. 
        This bolognese sauce comes from the northern region of Italy. With ground beef chuck, carrot, celery, 
        onion, nutmeg and Italian plum tomatoes, this dish is perfect for those cold winter nights. The trick to achieving 
        the soft, rich flavours is to allow the sauce to gently simmer on the stove over the course of several hours. In 
        the meantime, kick back, grab a glass of red wine and enjoy the evening!</p>
        <h3 class="header">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter plus 1 tablespoon for tossing the pasta</li>
            <li>1/2 cup onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup celery, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup carrot, chopped</li>
            <li>3/4 pound ground beef chuck, not too lean (or 1/2 pound ground beef chuck plus 1/4 pound ground pork, 
            preferably from the neck or Boston butt)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper, ground fresh from the mill</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>Whole nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups canned imported Italian plum tomatoes, cut up with their juice</li>
            <li>1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds pasta</li>
            <li>Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="header">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the oil, butter, and chopped onion in the pot, and turn the heat on to medium.</li>
            <li>Cook and stir the onion until it has become translucent, then add the chopped celery and carrot. Cook 
                for about 2 minutes, stirring the vegetables to coat them well.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef, a large pinch of salt, and a few grindings of pepper. Crumble the meat with a 
                fork, stir well, and cook until the beef has lost its raw, red color.</li>
            <li>Add the milk and let it simmer gently, stirring frequently, until it has bubbled away completely. Add 
                a tiny grating (about 1/8 teaspoon) of nutmeg and stir.</li>
            <li>Add the wine, let it simmer until it has evaporated, then add the tomatoes and stir thoroughly to coat 
                all ingredients well. When the tomatoes begin to bubble, turn the heat down so that the sauce cooks at 
                the laziest of simmers, with just an intermittent bubble breaking through to the surface. Cook, uncovered 
                for 3 hours or more, stirring from time to time. While the sauce is cooking, you are likely to find that 
                it begins to dry out and the fat separates from the meat. To keep it from sticking, continue the cooking, 
                adding 1/2 cup of water whenever necessary. At the end, however, no water at all must be left and the fat 
                must separate from the sauce. Taste and correct for salt.</li>
            <li>Toss with cooked drained pasta, adding the tablespoon of butter, and serve with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 
                on the side.</li>
        </ol>
